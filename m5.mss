Open as your sporty little pink Porsche pulls up in the courtyard of
TRESYLLIAN CASTLE, near Land's End in Cornwall.

You've driven here from London.  Darkness has fallen.  A full moon hangs
over the battlemented tower.

Indeed, little now remains of Tresyllian Castle but the central tower
keep and the crumbling walls of the outer bailey.

A veil of mist passes over the moon, and you experience a faint shiver
of mingled fear and excitement as you recall your reason for coming to
this remote southwestern corner of England.

Your old school friend, TAMARA LYND, comes running out to greet you with
a fond hug and kiss.

Several months ago, Tamara came to Tresyllian Castle to act as secretary
to young LORD JACK TRESYLLIAN, and also to help catalog the jumbled
volumes and manuscripts in the extensive library bequeathed to him by
his late Cousin Lionel, the previous Lord Tresyllian.

Romance quickly flowered between Tamara and her darkly handsome employer.
Lord Jack has already declared his love, and it's understood that they
will soon be married, altho as yet there has been no formal announcement
or engagement.

But a vague, foreboding menace clouds Tamara's happiness . . .

For one thing, Tresyllian Castle is said to be haunted by a white
wraithlike figure -- the ghost of an unhappy young bride who in the 16th
Century was accused of infidelity by her husband, the then Lord
Tresyllian, and in punishment was walled up alive somewhere in the
castle. 

The ghost had not been seen for more than a hundred years, and it was
assumed that the young bride's tormented spirit had finally been laid to
rest.

But now the spook has recently begun to appear again, flitting about the
dank, echoing stone corridors and stairways of the castle.

To make matters even more disquieting, one or two of the castle servants
who have glimpsed the phantom insist that the pale wraith resembles
DEIRDRE HALLAM.

Deirdre was a wild, willful, beautiful girl who died a year before our
story opens.  She and Lord Jack had been lovers, but they had quarreled
violently over her flirtations with other men.

The breakup of their romance shattered Deirdre.  One night she came to the
castle and, in the darkness, had either accidentally or intentionally
fallen or flung herself (or perhaps been pushed?) down an old wellshaft.

The well, long disused, now yields only brackish water, and it's
believed that the original spring has become polluted by an underground
tidal current.  Deirdre's body was never recovered and presumably was
washed out to sea.

But her emotional aura still lingers banefully over Tresyllian Castle. 
As a result of several recent weird incidents, Tamara is convinced that
someone's trying to kill her.

Can it be, she wonders, that Deirdre is still alive and is jealously
trying to eliminate her successful rival?

At any rate, this is why Tamara has sent for her old friend -- YOU, the
famous young teenage sleuth.

Who or what is behind the flitting white phantom figure that now haunts
Tresyllian Castle?

Hopefully no one suspects that you've really come to solve the mystery.

Officially you're here at Tamara's invitation, as one of the guests at
the small, intimate house party which Lord Jack has arranged in order to
announce their engagement.

Other guests include---

IRIS VANE...a kittenish Mayfair deb, who
comes on as an affectionate girl friend of Tamara's.  But she radiates
bitchy overtones which suggest that she may have secret designs of her
own on Lord Jack Tresyllian, and that she secretly hates Tamara for
beating her time with his lordship.

IAN FORDYCE...a sporty young London man-about-town and officer in the
Coldstream Guards.  He's a close buddy of Lord Jack's, who is himself an
ex-Guards officer.  Belowstairs gossip at the castle hints that Ian was
madly in love with Deirdre, and that it was a quarrel over him which led
to her breakup with Lord Jack.

DR NICHOLAS WENDISH...family friend, who teaches at Cambridge
University.  A medical doctor famed for his discoveries in biochemistry,
he specializes in plant drug research.

MONTAGUE HYDE...a London antique dealer who has come to Cornwall to
discuss with Lord Jack the possible sale of Tresyllian family portraits
and other objets d'art.

VIVIEN PENTREATH...a local painter of vintage beauty and uncertain age,
who is reputed to have been the mistress of Jack's late kinsman Lionel,
the previous Lord Tresyllian.

LIONEL TRESYLLIAN was a world-class adventurer, whose semi-scientific
explorations and hunting expeditions took him to all corners of the
globe. 

Eventually we'll learn that he accumulated a number of priceless
artifacts which for some mysterious reason never came to light at the
time of his death.  Could it be that they're still secreted somewhere in
the castle?

We'll also learn that one of his expeditions -- to the
Amazon jungle -- was in search of a rare native plant known
as the Moonflower.

According to reports, local Indians use a drug extracted
from this plant to tip their poison blowdarts.  They
insist that the plant should be gathered only when the
moon is misted over -- and for this reason have given the
drug a name in their own language which translates as
MOONMIST.

A certain passage in one of Lionel's expedition logs
hints that he succeeded in obtaining and bringing back
some of this drug, which he believes may have valuable
medical use as an anesthetic and painkiller with
revolutionary scientific properties.  But if so, what
happened to it . . . ?

In the course of the game, certain guests will be found
in a strange catatonic state -- eyes wide open and staring,
as if paralyzed with terror, unable to move or do more than
mumble a few word clues.

The same thing @u(could) happen to you, the player.

Hopefully, the effects may wear off in time, but even
Dr Wendish cannot foretell if or how soon this will
happen.

The victims, we'll learn eventually, have all been shot
with poison-tipped tiny blowdarts.

Only one thing seems certain.  A spook of some sort,
human or otherwise, is moving about the castle at night
with possibly deadly intent, searching for some hidden
treasure or object of great value.

The object of the game is to discover and retrieve the
hidden treasure -- and also to expose the sinister spook
before he adds you and your friend Tamara to his list of
victims. ###
