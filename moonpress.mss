@center[SPEND THE NIGHT IN A HAUNTED CASTLE]@* 
@center[Infocom Introduces an Interactive Gothic Mystery]

Cambridge, MA (June, 1986) -- @I[Help!  I think someone's trying to
kill me!  I know this sounds dramatic, but I really am scared!]

@I[You know I've never believed in ghosts.  But now I've actually seen
the White Lady!  It was so frightening!  I woke up in the middle of
the night, and there she was looking down at me.  Then an enormous
black widow spider dropped onto my bed!]

@I[A few days later, I opened my desk drawer and an adder reared out
and almost bit me.  Adders are such poisonous snakes that you can die
from the bite!]

@I[I know it's a big favor to ask because it's such a long way, but
won't you please come to help me?  You've solved so many mysteries.
I'm sure you can figure out this one!]

As a famous young sleuth ready for any and all adventures, you do not
hesitate a moment when you receive this letter from your friend
Tamara.  Before you can say "Sherlock", you've crossed the Atlantic and
are pulling up in front of Tresyllian Castle in Cornwall, England.

A full moon is rising above the battlemented tower, and the surf
pounds against the rocks at the bottom of the cliff.  Is that a
ghostly figure in the tower window, or merely the mist playing tricks
on your weary eyes?  You'll soon find out.  When you announce
yourself, you'll be admitted to the castle.  You'll also gain entrance
to the gothic world of MOONMIST, the latest interactive mystery from
Infocom.

Once inside Tresyllian Castle, you meet a cast of eccentric characters
ranging from a blue-blood debutant to an overly helpful butler.  Most
of them have seen the ghost.  And some say it looks just like Deirdre,
the former lover of Tamara's fiance, Lord Jack Tresyllian.  Dierdre
purportedly drowned shortly after Jack ended their romance.  Could it
be that Deirdre is still alive, jealously taking a terrible revenge on
Tamara?

To add to the suspense, you learn that a valuable object is hidden
somewhere in the castle.  This treasure rightfully belongs to Lord
Jack, but apparently he is not the only one searching for it.  If it's
not found, family heirlooms will have to be sold to pay off debts.
You find yourself involved in a treasure hunt as well as a mystery, as
you search the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the castle for
the hiding place.  Clues are given in the form of riddles, which hold
the answers to the puzzles in the game.

There are four different variations to MOONMIST, all contained on the
same game disk.  Each variation has its puzzles, treasure, hiding
place, and solution to the mystery.  This gives MOONMIST more replay
value than any other Infocom story to date, providing you with plenty
of time to savor the gothic atmosphere of the castle.

Geared to Introductory Level players age 9 and up, MOONMIST was
written by Stu Galley and Jim Lawrence.  Galley, one of Infocom's
in-house group of writers, is the author of THE WITNESS, a hard-boiled
whodunit, and SEASTALKER, Infocom's first Introductory Level story.
Lawrence is co-author of SEASTALKER and the author of dozens of books
for children and adults, including numerous Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew
stories.

"Mysteries are my favorite type of interactive fiction," says Galley.
"I'd like as many people as possible to enjoy interactive mysteries as
I do, so I geared MOONMIST to those who might not have tried our games
or who have found them too hard.  I wanted something a little easier
than THE WITNESS, which some people had difficulty finishing."

MOONMIST is an especially good introduction to interactive fiction for
women, who often have trouble finding computer entertainment programs
that are not exclusively male-oriented.  Infocom has been praised for
producing programs that were not geared specifically to men.  MOONMIST
goes one step further, incorporating a gothic setting with the mystery
genre, both elements that are traditionally appealing to women.  

This does not mean, however, that men will not like MOONMIST.  The
story has been designed to be fully enjoyed by either men or women.
When you announce yourself at the castle gate at the start of the
story, you can identify yourself as male or female.  From then on, the
program responds accordingly.  If you're a woman, you have a gown to
put on for dinner.  A man's suitcase will contain a dinner jacket.
Lord Jack will kiss a woman's hand.  If you're a man, he'll shake
yours.

The program will also respond to you by name throughout the story, so
you can take advantage of the elegant surroundings by calling yourself
"Baron" or "Lady" rather than just "Mr." or "Ms."

To introduce you to mysterious Cornwall, the game package contains an
illustrated copy of "Legendary Ghosts of Cornwall."  Also included are
a MOONMIST iron-on logo for your T-shirt; a visitors' guide to
Tresyllian Castle; and two confidential letters from your friend
Tamara.

Scheduled for October release, MOONMIST will be available for a wide
variety of personal computers, including Apple II series and
Macintosh, Atari XL/XE and ST series, Commodore 64/128 and Amiga, and
IBM PC series and MS-DOS compatibles.  It will retail for $39.95.
