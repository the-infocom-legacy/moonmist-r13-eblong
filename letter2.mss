April 15

Hi there!

You'll never believe what's happened!  I'm living in a castle in
Cornwall, engaged to marry a British lord!  Now I'll be able to sit
around in drawing rooms, making polite conversation and sipping tea.
What a life!

I guess you're wondering why I'm not back at Kent State.  After
finishing my semester here, I couldn't bear to come right home.  So I
figured I'd take a few months off and get some sort of job to see me
through.  I found an ad for a secretary to a Lord Jack Tresyllian at
his castle in Cornwall, and now here I am!

Lord Jack wasn't at all what I'd expected.  He's a young,
down-to-earth guy, and not bad looking, either.  I was a goner from
the start.  Luckily he felt the same way, or I might be flinging
myself off the cliff!  We're announcing our engagement at a party on
May 3 for all the local blue bloods.  I wish you could be here to help
me remember which fork to use!

Seriously, some of these upper crust types will never speak to you
again if you wear the wrong outfit to dinner.  I'm really glad Jack
has a sense of humor about it.  He helps me to keep mine!

There @u[is] one bohemian in the crowd.  Her name is Vivien Pentreath,
and she's a painter and sculptor who lives nearby.  She's one of those
women who looks just as beautiful at 50 as she did at 25.  According
to Jack, she was the mistress of his Uncle Lionel, the previous Lord
Tresyllian.  Vivien's family has lived in Cornwall for ages and she can
tell lots of wonderful old stories.

One person I could do without is Iris Vane (she's really called the
Honourable Iris Vane, but you won't catch @u[me] calling her that).
She's this Mayfair debutant who came on as an instant friend of mine.
But there's something bitchy about her, and I think she's secretly in
love with Jack.  I guess castles breed romantic tangles.

Jack's best friend is Ian Fordyce.  Ian's an officer in the Coldstream
Guards and a real lady's man.  According to Iris, Ian was madly in
love with Deirdre Hallam, Jack's old girlfriend.  Deirdre was never
able to resist flirting with another man.  But her involvement with
Ian was the last straw for Jack, and they broke up.

Although this didn't seem to hurt Jack and Ian's friendship, something
terrible happened to Deirdre.  She was really upset by the breakup and
ended up drowning in a well right here at the castle.  Her body was
never found.  The water in the well is very salty, so they think it's
been polluted by an underground tidal current and that she was washed
out to sea.

Deirdre's death is really fueling the imaginations of some of the
castle servants.  Supposedly this place is haunted by an ancient ghost
called the White Lady.  Now they're saying that the White Lady has
been seen in the newer Residential Wing of the castle (like any good
ghost, she used to stick to the old section) and that she looks just
like Deirdre.  Whoo-ee-ooo!

I think Deirdre's family has fallen under the spell of some old
Cornish curse.  Her grandfather, Mr. Poldark, also died recently under
unusual circumstances.  He became ill and went to a London doctor who
specializes in strange drugs extracted from plants.  As you might
guess, the cure didn't work.  The doctor, whose name is Wendish, was
Uncle Lionel's best friend.  He still comes to visit every now and
then, and he really gives me the creeps.

Well, I suppose I can't blame him for wanting to stay at the castle.
Everyone loves it here.  I'm sending along a copy of the tourist
brochure (the place is open to the public on weekends) so you can read
all about it.  The brochure mentions the White Lady.  I'm sure she's a
great tourist gimmick.

If you look at the second floor map, you'll see the library where I've
been helping Jack catalog Uncle Lionel's collection of books and
manuscripts.  Lionel didn't spend his time at home looking after the
estate the way Jack does.  Instead, he used up the family fortune
travelling all around the world.  His last trip was to the Amazon
River in South America, where he caught some sort of fatal jungle
disease.

The last months of Lionel's life were spent here in bed, and the
castle was opened to the public in order to pay off his debts and
medical bills.  When Lionel died, Jack inherited everything, but he
still hasn't been able to straighten out the finances.  Supposedly
Lionel hid a valuable treasure somewhere in the castle.  If we can
find it, we won't have to sell off the family heirlooms to pay
Lionel's debts.  

An antique dealer named Montague Hyde is always toddling down from
London to see what he can get his hands on.  I should be nicer to Mr.
Hyde, who isn't such a bad sort, but every time I see him I'm reminded
that all these beautiful things, some of which have been in the family
for six or seven hundred years, might be on their way out the door.  I
think it should all be kept here forever.

I could go on and on about Cornwall and the castle and the strange
habits of the upper crust, but I need to wade through a few more of
Lionel's papers before dinner.  I told Jack that I'd keep on with the
cataloguing, even though I'm no longer his secretary.  Who wants him
bringing another woman in here?

Well, I hope to hear from you soon.  I miss you and the rest of the
gang and can't wait for you to come visit.  It might be a long way,
but how often do you get to stay in a "haunted" castle!  

Lots of love,

Tamara
