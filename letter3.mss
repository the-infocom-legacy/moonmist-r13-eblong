Help!  

I think someone's trying to kill me!  I know this sounds dramatic, but
I really am scared!

You know I've never believed in ghosts.  But now I've actually seen
the White Lady!  It was so frightening!  I woke up in the middle of
the night, and there she was looking down at me.  She had this
terrible pale face which suddenly disappeared.  Then an enormous black
widow spider dropped onto my bed!  I screamed and shook it off my
blanket and by the time Jack got there it was gone.

At first, I thought it was just a horrible dream.  But a few days
later, I opened my desk drawer and an adder reared out and almost bit
me.  Adders are such poisonous snakes that you can die from the bite!
This time, the snake was found, so I knew it really happened.

No one has ever been threatened by the White Lady before.  But some of
the people who've seen the ghost recently say it looks just like
Deirdre Hallam, that old girlfriend of Jack's who drowned in the
castle well.  Do you think she's come back to torment me for taking
her place?  

I don't know what to do!  I know it's a big favor to ask because it's
such a long way, but won't you please come to help me?  You've solved
so many mysteries.  I'm sure you can figure out this one!

Love, Tamara
